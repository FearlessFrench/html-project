# HTML Project
### About
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.

This project is a hands-on guide designed for anyone who wants to quickly learn or refresh their knowledge of essential HTML concepts. The files are structured to provide a logical, step-by-step review, moving from basic syntax to more complex web page elements.

The goal is to provide a focused and practical learning experience. Each file in this repository is a self-contained example, allowing you to explore a specific topic in detail.
