# HTML Project
### About
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.

HTML is one of the fundamental technologies you need to learn when starting out in web development. It is present in every single webpage online. Once you have a good grasp of the fundamental concepts of HTML, you will be well-equipped to move on to other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

HTML has gone through many revisions and changes since its creation. The most recent and standardized version is HTML5, which is widely used today.

### Key Principles of HTML
- __Structure__: HTML provides the basic structure of a web page, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

- __Elements and Tags__: HTML consists of elements represented by tags. These tags label pieces of content such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

- __Attributes__: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are always included in the opening tag and come in name/value pairs like `charset="utf-8"`.

### Getting Started
To run these projects, you'll need a code editor like Visual Studio Code and a local web server with a live reload feature. We recommend using the Live Server extension.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)

2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. Install the Live Server Extension:
    - Open the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
    - In the search bar, type Live Server.
    - Click the Install button for the extension by Ritwick Dey.

4. Run a project:
    - Navigate to a project folder, like 01_website.
    - Right-click on the index.html file in the Explorer panel.
    - Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.

Your default web browser will open automatically and display the project. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser whenever you save the file.
